# Netlify Deployment Success

## Solution Summary
The persistent 404 errors on Netlify deployment were resolved by switching from Python functions to JavaScript functions.

## Key Changes Made:
1. Created JavaScript function files:
   - `index.js`: Handles main routes with HTML response
   - `api.js`: Simple JSON API endpoint

2. Updated `netlify.toml` configuration:
   - Simplified redirects
   - Removed Python-specific configuration

3. Modified `build.sh` to include JavaScript function files during build.

## Working Endpoints:
- `/.netlify/functions/main` - Main function (working)
- `/.netlify/functions/index` - Index function (working)
- `/api` - API endpoint (working)
- `/` - Root path (working)

## Next Steps:
1. Implement the actual FastAPI application using JavaScript functions as proxies
2. Update routing to handle dynamic routes
3. Set up database connections and environment variables
