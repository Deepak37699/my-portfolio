# Netlify 404 Debugging Strategy

## Current Status: Investigating Root Cause

We've been experiencing persistent 404 errors with the Netlify deployment. Here's our systematic debugging approach:

## 🔍 Debugging Steps Implemented

### Step 1: Configuration Fixes ✅
- ✅ Fixed function handler name (`main` → `handler`)
- ✅ Corrected Python runtime (3.11 → 3.8)
- ✅ Updated redirect configurations
- ✅ Enhanced static index.html with loading UI

### Step 2: Diagnostic Functions ✅
- ✅ Created simple `test.py` function to verify basic Netlify Functions work
- ✅ Added `/test` route for isolated testing
- ✅ Enhanced error handling with debug information

### Step 3: Error Analysis (In Progress)
- 🔄 **Test the simple function first**: `/test`
- 🔄 **Check FastAPI function**: `/.netlify/functions/main`
- 🔄 **Analyze deployment logs** if still failing

## 🧪 Test URLs After Deployment

1. **Simple Function Test**: `https://YOUR-DEPLOY-URL/test`
   - This should show a basic success page if Netlify Functions work
   
2. **FastAPI Function Test**: `https://YOUR-DEPLOY-URL/.netlify/functions/main`
   - This should show either the portfolio or detailed error information
   
3. **Root URL**: `https://YOUR-DEPLOY-URL/`
   - Should redirect to the FastAPI function

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes

### If `/test` works but FastAPI doesn't:
- Issue is with FastAPI import/configuration
- Python dependencies or path issues
- FastAPI app structure problems

### If neither works:
- Netlify Functions not working at all
- Build configuration issues
- Runtime environment problems

### If both work:
- Redirect configuration issue
- Static file serving problems

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Wait for deployment** (1-2 minutes)
2. **Test the simple function** at `/test`
3. **Check the FastAPI function** directly
4. **Analyze any error messages** in the debug output
5. **Check Netlify function logs** if needed

## 🛠️ Current Configuration

**netlify.toml**:
```toml
[build]
  command = "bash build.sh"
  functions = "netlify/functions"
  publish = "netlify/static"

[build.environment]
  PYTHON_VERSION = "3.8"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/test"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/test"
  status = 200

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/main/:splat"
  status = 200
  force = true
```

**Function Structure**:
- `netlify/functions/test.py` - Simple diagnostic function
- `netlify/functions/main.py` - FastAPI handler with debug info
- Both have proper `handler(event, context)` entry points
