# Netlify 404 Error - Fix Summary

## Problem
The Netlify deployment was successful but returning a 404 "Page not found" error when accessing the site. This was happening because Netlify couldn't properly route requests to the FastAPI application.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Incorrect function handler name**: Netlify Functions require the entry point to be named `handler`, not `main`
2. **Python import path issues**: The module resolution wasn't working correctly in the Netlify environment
3. **Over-complicated redirect**: The `:splat` parameter in the redirect was causing routing issues
4. **Basic fallback page**: The static index.html was too simple and didn't provide good user experience

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Function Handler Name
**File**: `netlify/functions/main.py`
```python
# Changed from:
def main(event, context):

# To:
def handler(event, context):
```

### 2. Updated Python Path Resolution
**File**: `netlify/functions/main.py`
```python
# Fixed import path to work within Netlify Functions environment
current_dir = Path(__file__).parent
sys.path.insert(0, str(current_dir))
```

### 3. Simplified Redirect Configuration  
**File**: `netlify.toml`
```toml
# Changed from:
to = "/.netlify/functions/main/:splat"

# To:
to = "/.netlify/functions/main"
```

### 4. Enhanced Static Index Page
**File**: `build.sh` - Updated static index.html with:
- Modern loading spinner and UI
- Gradient background design
- JavaScript redirect with fallback link
- Better user experience during loading

## Verification Steps
1. ✅ Dependencies install correctly
2. ✅ FastAPI app imports successfully  
3. ✅ Handler function imports without errors
4. ✅ Build script completes successfully
5. ✅ Changes committed and pushed to trigger new deployment

## Expected Result
After the new deployment completes, the site should:
1. Load the enhanced loading page at the root URL
2. Automatically redirect to the FastAPI application via Netlify Functions
3. Display the full portfolio with all routes working correctly

## Next Steps
1. Wait for Netlify deployment to complete (usually 1-2 minutes)
2. Test the site URL: https://684af9b393f5f7d8f078db76--deepak37699.netlify.app/
3. Verify all routes work correctly (/projects, /skills, /about, /contact, /admin)
4. Check that static assets load properly

## Files Modified
- `netlify/functions/main.py` - Fixed handler name and imports
- `netlify.toml` - Simplified redirect configuration  
- `build.sh` - Enhanced static index.html
- `test_netlify_function.py` - Added local testing capability

## Monitoring
If the 404 error persists after this deployment, check:
1. Netlify build logs for any errors
2. Function logs in Netlify dashboard
3. Browser network tab for failed requests
4. Use the test script locally: `python test_netlify_function.py`
